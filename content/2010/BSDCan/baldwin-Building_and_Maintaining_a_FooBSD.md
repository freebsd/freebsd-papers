FreeBSD works great for many tasks out of the box. As an open source
operating system, FreeBSD can be customized to optimally perform
specialized tasks.  This talk will cover some of the nuts and bolts of
managing a customized version of FreeBSD.  It is aimed at the server
market rather than the embedded space. Topics will include strategies
for maintaining local patches to the source tree, deploying unattended
installs, and upgrading the OS version.
