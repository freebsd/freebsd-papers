Operators of computer systems need to be aware of the state of their systems. As systems and networks become more intricate, the need for this information increases. This increase in complexity also leads to an increase in failure modes, often creating modes unique to the environment. This means that any monitoring setup must be as unique as the environment it operates on if it is going to be of use. As a result, it is frequently not possible to simply run an off-the-shelf solution, and an understanding of the principles behind monitoring systems must be applied to the implementation of your solution. This paper will cover many of the basic areas for monitoring, and how they can be applied to FreeBSD systems.
