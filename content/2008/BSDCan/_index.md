BSDCan 2008 was held on 16-17 May 2008 at University of Ottawa, and was preceeded by two days of Tutorials on 14-15 May 2008.

BSDCan, a BSD conference held in Ottawa, Canada, has quickly established itself as the technical conference for people working on and with 4.4BSD based operating systems and related projects. The organizers have found a fantastic formula that appeals to a wide range of people from extreme novices to advanced developers.
