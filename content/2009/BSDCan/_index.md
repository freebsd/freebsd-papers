BSDCan 2009 was held on 8-9 May 2009 at University of Ottawa, and was preceded by two days of Tutorials on 6-7 May 2009.

BSDCan, a BSD conference held in Ottawa, Canada, has quickly established itself as the technical conference for people working on and with 4.4BSD based operating systems and related projects. The organizers have found a fantastic formula that appeals to a wide range of people from extreme novices to advanced developers.
