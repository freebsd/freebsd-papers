The ever increasing mobility of computers has made protection of
data on digital storage media an important requirement in a number
of applications and situations. GBDE is a strong cryptographic
facility for denying unau- thorised access to data stored on a
‘‘cold’’ disk for decades and longer. GBDE operates on the
disk(-partition) level allowing any type of file system or database
to be protected. A significant focus has been put on the practical
aspects in order to make it possible to deploy GBDE in the real
world.
