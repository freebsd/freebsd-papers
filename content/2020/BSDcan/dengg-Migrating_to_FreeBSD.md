While I have been using Linux actively in one way or another (not counting embedded systems where i don't have access) for over 20 years now, i have been migrating some stuff to FreeBSD recently (Everything from a forced migration of my daily driver to a more planed migration of production servers and firewalls).

While I have heard the term "Linuxisms" quite a bit, things are different at times and that might be good or bad depending on the point of view.

I want to present the challenges i faced (and I'm still facing at times) in my process of migrating installations, both technical as well as the discussions you face when people think you are trying something new and esoteric because they might not have heard of it).
