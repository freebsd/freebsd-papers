The basics of deploying Ansible on FreeBSD specifically for networking environments.

The talk focuses on the basics of deploying Ansible on FreeBSD specifically for networking environments (the kind of libraries that are required, what are the potential alternatives etc). A small demo will be presented on how this deployment would be done with a breakdown version of the command structure and demonstration from the command line. The talk will additionally focus on difficulties/challenges in deploying this on FreeBSD compared to deploying in on a Debian-based system.
