A talk about past changes and potential future changes in PostgreSQL and FreeBSD that aim to make this combination the best relational database platform.

PostgreSQL and FreeBSD have many things in common, including ancestry at Berkeley, similar project structures and a pesky more popular rival. This talk will cover some recent changes made over the past years in both projects to improve the performance and user experience of this stack, some ongoing work and many ideas for future improvements. In some cases it’s a matter of catching up with Linux, and in others it’s entirely new possibilities. The talk will finish with a question: “what would you change if we could change anything?”, because, well, we can!

Please see <https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/FreeBSD> for links and details on the topics discussed.
