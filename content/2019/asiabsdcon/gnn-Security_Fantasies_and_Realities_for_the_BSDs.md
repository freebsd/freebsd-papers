With the advancement of computers into every day life over the past 40 years, the security of operating systems that were originally developed for scientific research, has become a day to day concern. As the BSDs have grown in size and complexity, so too have the threats that confront them. The various branches of the BSD family have taken different approaches to security during the course of their development, with greater or less success in achieving the goal of a secure, and yet usable, system. This talk will review the state of security across several of the BSDs, looking both at their successes and their failures and what we can learn from the last several years of security work across the BSD family.
