They say MQTT is a PUB/SUB protocol for the Internet of Things, which it was originally designed for, but it's also well suited for monitoring machines and services, in other words, for our daily bread. We take a close look at the MQTT protocol and show you applications for MQTT, focusing on putting it to use for systems administration tasks, for monitoring, and for connecting microcontrollers to your server farms (strike that part when you show this to your boss).

We'll divulge what a last will and testament has to do with MQTT and monitoring, and we'll also discuss some real-world integrations and applications of MQTT and Unix system utilities.

Attendees will be able to understand how they can profit from using MQTT for monitoring programs, and they will benefit from being able to use the protocol for lightweight messaging.

Be warned: there will be blinkenlights!
