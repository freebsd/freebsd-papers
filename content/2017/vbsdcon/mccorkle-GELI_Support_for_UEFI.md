We exist in a delicate balance and special niche. The world is moving quickly to embrace operating systems concepts that are not particularly associated with BSD.

Though we remain vibrant today, we are more at risk than the competition, especially in terms of pipeline dynamics. As our average age creeps up, what are the organic vectors in place to bring new blood into the community? What is our argument for relevance? What are the challenges? To what problems are we the unique solution? What business and cultural mistakes are we making, right now, that have unintended consequences for our long term viability? Where does FreeBSD respond best to new problems that the hobbyist-level general public now confronts? Where has the FreeBSD community seen the most organic, new growth and depth of participation in the past several years?

These questions have answers, many of them surprising and unexpected. Now is the time to put these questions on the radar, and to make their answers part of our collective discussion. The past twelve months have seen some close shaves that many have not noticed that had the potential knock pegs out from under our relevance in ways that would be hard to rectify. The situation is, perhaps, more delicate than we broadly understand. But there is good news: we find ourselves in the right place, at the right time. It is our appliances which showcase our best achievements---and the unbelievably dynamic communities around them---that can be our salvation, for these are the places that new blood is seeing that we are the best, and have no competition. If we do it right.
