This paper presents a pioneering initiative to integrate OpenStack, an
open-source cloud computing platform, with FreeBSD, a robust Unix-like operating
system. Traditionally, OpenStack has been closely associated with Linux-based
environments, leveraging specific Linux features and technologies. This
integration aims to expand OpenStack's applicability by harnessing FreeBSD's
advanced networking, security, and efficient resource management capabilities.
