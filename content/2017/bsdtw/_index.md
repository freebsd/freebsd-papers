title: BSD Taiwan
---
11-12 November 2017, Beitou Resort, Taipei, Taiwan.

BSDTW 2017 is planned as a single track, 2 days conference with 11 presentations of 50 minutes each covering the latest BSD technology. The conference will attract over 100 highly skilled engineering professionals, software developers, computer science professors, users and students from all over Asia as well as other parts of the world. The goal of BSDTW is to exchange knowledge about the BSD operating systems, facilitate coordination and cooperation among users and developers and to promote business friendly BSD licensed open source software.

Taiwan has a long history with BSD systems, many of the top websites in Taiwan are using FreeBSD as their main server OS, also, OpenBSD and NetBSD are used in many products from local companies. In education networks, FreeBSD is usually the first choice for the server OS because of its stability and performance. There are more than a dozen FreeBSD developers and many BSD users in Taiwan, but they tend to be silent in the past few years, because of there is no event and they are busy at their positions. We believe BSDTW will draw in both old friends who are now serving important roles in companies or academia. By participating in BSDTW you can promote your company to decision makers, attract mind share, scout for highly skilled future employees or simply return something to the ecosystem if you are already using a BSD operating systems in your business or products.
