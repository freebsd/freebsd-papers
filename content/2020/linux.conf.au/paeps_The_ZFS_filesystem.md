Watch Trouble present a three-day workshop on ZFS in however little time the conference organisers were willing to allocate for it! We'll cover topics from filesystem reliability over snapshots and volume management to future directions in ZFS.

ZFS is known as 'the last word in filesystems'. This workshop will get your hands dirty with installing, configuring and managing reliable and scalable storage systems with ZFS on FreeBSD. We will cover pool-based storage, optimising storage systems for performance and redundancy and practise zero-downtime recovery from common storage events such as failing disks or running out of space. Participants should bring a laptop with either VirtualBox or VMware installed.
