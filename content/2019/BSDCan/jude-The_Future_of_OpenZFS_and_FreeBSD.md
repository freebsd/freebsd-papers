An overview of the forthcoming changes to the OpenZFS Project, and how FreeBSD will interact with the OpenZFS Project.

This talk will discuss:

* How the OpenZFS project has changed
* New problems as ZFS has matured (deprecation policy)
* How the OpenZFS project is working to reduce the differences across platforms (command line switches, NFS interoperability)
* Interoperability improvements (feature flag 'compatibility' groups)
* New procedures to prevent divergence and coordinate development across platforms (reserving flags, wider discussion before names for features/flags are decided)
* The monthly ZFS Leadership Call

Then switch gears and cover FreeBSD specific issues:

* The switch to ZoL as upstream
* Why we are making the change
* What we get out of it
* How it is better for all of OpenZFS
* Status report
* ZoL is OpenZFS, not Linux
* There is no LinuxKPI in ZFS (kill the FUD)
* What has OpenZFS done for me lately

Then an overview of upcoming changes and features in ZFS.
